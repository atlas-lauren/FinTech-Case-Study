# THE GRAPH

## What is The Graph?

The Graph is a **open-source, decentralized query and indexing protocol** for blockchains.[^1] But what does *that* mean? It may help to define our terms: 

* **blockchain** - a revolutionary way to store data publicly, yet securely, so it can be used by all participants in a decentralized system. 

* **[decentralized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) system** - decision-making, administrative, and planning functions are performed at a local level, not concentrated in a central authority. 

* **protocol** - rules.

* **internet protocol** - a set of rules to define how data is shared across computers. Really, The internet as we know it, the "World Wide Web," is possible because people all over the world can learn and follow basic internet protocol, and by following internet protocol they tap into a connected system across the world. 

* **query protocol** - a set of rules that allows you to retrieve data. Google is a query protocol. All databases need a query protocol to pull information out of the depths. 

* **indexing protocol** - a set of rules that tells you how to index your data so it's universally searchable. Twitter's hashtags are a form of indexing protocol.

* **open-source** - information that is available to all, both to contribute and to view.  

* **decentralized internet** - an internet model that doesn't have to rely on centralized data to be convenient and effective. In this model individuals can retain control over their own data but still participate in a highly functional, global internet. Blockchains - and cryptocurrency - are a huge reason why this model of the internet seems possible *now* in  way it hasn't been before. Blockchains can be used to automate complex administrative processes that, historically, needed to be operated or at least supervised by a live person. And it's the need to organize live people that leads to a centralized system.

* **["Web3"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3)** - a decentralized internet model, currently associated with blockchain platforms like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Solana](https://solana.com/community?gclid=CjwKCAiAo4OQBhBBEiwA5KWu_4ohcizpxi9jHvbojpbd9-FEPvN8XN5ocJAyNT4HW20D0JUA_WRA7hoCrkEQAvD_BwE), [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Near](https://near.org/), [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/intro), [Binance](https://www.binance.us/en/home), and [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/).

## Why does it matter?

Jargon aside, the easiest way to think about the Graph is: Google for blockchains. Google indexed the world wide web to create a search engine that took in natural language and returned highly satisfying search results.[] The Graph is indexing blockchains with the goal of building a highly functional search engine for an internet built on blockchains. And like Google made the world wide web accesible to all, The Graph wants make blockchain accessible to everyone.[^4] In the words of one of its founders: ["If web3 is going to catch on we need to provide experiences that are as good or better than centralized alternatives."](https://medium.com/graphprotocol/introducing-the-graph-4a281b28203e)

**But The Graph isn't Google.**

It isn't Google for the same reason web3 isn't web2: The Graph is decentralized, and Google is centralized. We end up back at the same philosophical difference about how to operate complex organizations and systems.

So while Google depends on a centralized model to function - centralized servers, decisionmaking centralized in a corporation - The Graph is being built on a decentralized model. Instead of relying on a group of people bound together by the corporation, its administrative wheels are greased by the incentive of earning GRT Coin.

## Founder's Story

The team at The Graph are true believers in the decentralized internet. It was founded in 2018 by [Yaniv Tal](https://twitter.com/yanivgraph), [Brandon Ramirez](https://twitter.com/RezBrandon), and [Jannis Pohlman](https://twitter.com/jannispohlmann). As software engineers, they had worked together on a few startups before beginning to build decentralized applications - dApps - in Ethereum in 2017.

Coming from the more mature centralized model, it was quickly apparent that blockchains didn't have a great search function. Web3 might *publish* everything as open-source information but that didn't mean it was readily *accessible*. This was a problem, not only because it made it difficult to build dApps, but because they could see the writing on the wall. If web3 wasn't searchable, how could it ever become widely used?

"The idea of making open data more accessible became an obsession of ours and The Graph was born."

It [first publicized](https://medium.com/graphprotocol/introducing-the-graph-4a281b28203e) its existence on June 5, 2018, on Twitter. It raised several million dollars throughout 2019, and them made an Initial Coin Offering on the Ethereum network on October 28, 2020, securing $12 million.[^4](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-graph/investor_financials)

The Initial Coin Offering is somewhat mystifying to those of us still in the mainstream system, but in mainstream terms, The Graph "went public." It's stock is its GRT coin.In the ICO, The Graph sold about 400 million GRT tokens for $0.03, payable in Ethereum (ETH), netting $12 million ETH. In October 2020 ETH hovered around $400 per coin, meaning The Graph brought in about 30,000 ETH. But ETH has increased in value a lot since October 2020. As of February 13, 2022, ETH traded at $2,888 (off its almost $5,000 peak in late 2021) - which means that The Graph's initial $12 million in ETH is now worth over $86 million. But that doesn't take into account the rise in value of GRT itself. In February 2022, GRT is trading around $0.40 - $0.50, off its 2021 peak of $2.87. There are almost 5 billion GRT coins in circulation at the moment, with a max supply of 10 billion GRT coins. The Graph Foundation regulates those coins, but - like a government - it essentially prints that money. At half a doller for one GRT, it could sell off 5 billion GRT tomorrow and raise $2.5 billion (if enough people were interested, and that's pretty much a deal-breaking "if.")

The Graph did strategically cash in on this investment recently though. On January 21, 2022, it announced that it raised $50 million through a ["strategic GRT sale from its treasury."](https://thegraph.com/blog/graph-raise) This money will be used to hire development talent to further grow its decentralized protocol.

Reception to The Graph has been generally positive.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

## Historical Context
Defining how data can be shared makes it possible to share data - without protocols, the internet can't exist. Blockchain has opened up a new frontier of protocols

[^4] Because even if information is *available* to all, that doesn't mean it's *usable* by all. Search engines evolved from querying protocols that were used in databases - think [boolean operators](https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=175963&p=1158594) and [separate search fields](https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=175963&p=1158752). These database search methods require some precision from the person searching, and in turn deliver precise results. But precision is hard. It takes mental effort. Most people don't want to waste time with it, and even those who feel it isn't a waste of time will spend more energy being precise, and have less energy for reading content. Being precise is also next to impossible if you're in a hurry - would you be able to enter precise map coordinates to your destination?

Accessibility is key, especially for a system built on transparency. The U.S. Code is publicly available, and theoretically it's even open-source (in that citizens can contribute to its creation by electing officials that will change the laws in a way the citizens would like). In practice, though it's accessible to only the elite tier who study it.
